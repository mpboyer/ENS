  abstract = {The k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm (k-WL) is a fruitful
              approach to the Graph Isomorphism problem. 2-WL corresponds to the
              original algorithm suggested by Weisfeiler and Leman over 50 years
              ago. 1-WL is the classical color refinement routine.
              Indistinguishability by k-WL is an equivalence relation on graphs
              that is of fundamental importance for isomorphism testing,
              descriptive complexity theory, and graph similarity testing which
              is also of some relevance in artificial intelligence. Focusing on
              dimensions k=1,2, we investigate subgraph patterns whose counts are
              k-WL invariant, and whose occurrence is k-WL invariant. We achieve
              a complete description of all such patterns for dimension k=1 and
              considerably extend the previous results known for k=2.},
